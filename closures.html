     * A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references
     * to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives
     * you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function.
     *
     * Lexical Scope:- In lexical scoping free variables must belong to a parent scope.
     *
     * Dynamic Scope:- In dynamic scoping free variables must belong to the calling scope
     *
